    <h1>My Projects</h1>
<p>
Here are a few of the projects I’ve worked on so far:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal Portfolio Website:</strong> The site you’re viewing right now! Built with HTML and CSS, hosted on GitHub Pages.</li>
  <li><strong>AI Chatbot Prototype:</strong> A simple chatbot built during my early experiments with artificial intelligence.</li>
  <li><strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong> Small contributions to open source projects, learning by doing and collaborating.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’m excited to keep building and adding more projects here as I learn and grow.
