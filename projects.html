        <p>Here are a few of the projects I’ve worked on so far:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Portfolio Website:</strong> The site you’re viewing right now! Built with HTML and CSS, hosted on GitHub Pages.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Chatbot Prototype:</strong> A simple chatbot built during my early experiments with artificial intelligence.</li>
            <li><strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong> Small contributions to open source projects, learning by doing and collaborating.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’m excited to keep building and adding more projects here as I learn and grow.</p>
